# Very opinionated workflow
**for static HTML/SASS/JS projects**

This project is meant to simplify the repetitive process of creating static web projects. It's based on subjective choice of tools and frameworks (gulp, bootstrap, html5 boilerplate, sass etc.). Cut down to bare essentials.

##How to:
`gulp` - starts dev mode

`gulp dist` - minifies code, optimizes images

Images should be kept in `app/img` folder
